# Intune
I will try to share the Intune profile configurations here, hopefully they will be useful to someone.

As a first step I'm sharing Intune Security Baseline according to the CIS benchmark in JSON file. These are the recommended settings according to CIS standards for end station security. 
It is super easy to import this JSON into the Intune environment using the IntuneManagement - Master application.
